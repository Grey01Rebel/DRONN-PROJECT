# DRONNE-PROJECT
This project is one I aim to use to in learning Bootstrap, I hope to have fun and get better at problem solving, thanks for reading.

In this project, I gained basic understanding of bootstrap, how to apply responsiveness to individual elements, how to customize some properties. It is just a simple one page website, but I'll be building more once I gain more knowledge bootstrap, I also have plans to explore Tailwind CSS as it utility based which contrasts boootstrap.

NOTE: Javascript was used in the accordion, an aspect of my journey I haven't explored,but would very soon.
The styling was inline, but I would also be exploring other styling options and would always update my progress.
